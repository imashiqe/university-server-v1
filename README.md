## Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd University-Management
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following configuration:

     ```env
     PORT=3000
     DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/university_db
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     ```

     Adjust `PORT`, `DB_URI`, and `JWT_SECRET` as needed.

## Start the Application

1. **Add the development start script to your `package.json`:**

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start:dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/index.ts"
   }
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   This script uses `ts-node-dev` to watch for changes and restart the server as needed.
